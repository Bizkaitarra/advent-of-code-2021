# Advent of Code 2021 done with PHP

## Â¿How is this made?

There is one folder for each day in src and tests folders. In tests I test first the example values
and then I make test for my personal input values. In my personal input values I first do echo 
of the value I return to fill the https://adventofcode.com web input. If it is OK I complete 
the test making sure that the value is the one is expected.


## Some notes about solutions

### Day 6

I always try to make the solution using object oriented solution with clean code. In this case,
the solution must be more efficient so I made a functional solution with less cost.
